Strange Attractors is a concept in the field of Chaos Theory and non-linear dynamics. They are a type of mathematical object that defines the behavior of certain dynamic systems.

In a dynamic system, the state evolves over time based on a set of equations. The behavior of the system can be sensitive to initial conditions, meaning that even the slightest change in the initial states can lead to drastically different outcomes. Attractors are often stable points (equilibrium states) or periodic orbits, meaning the system settles into a fixed point or repeats a pattern.

However, strange attractors are different. They exhibit complex and chaotic behavior. Unlike regular attractors, strange attractors are characterized by complex geometric patterns. The term "Strange" refers to the unusual, intricate nature of their behavior.

Strange Attractors can have fractal geometry (self-similar patterns at different scales). They can have an infinite number of unstable periodic orbits, and even minor changes in the starting points can have entirely different results; this is what makes them part of chaotic systems.

Strange attractors have been studied in various fields, including physics, mathematics, biology, and economics. They provide insights into the behavior of complex systems, where small changes in initial conditions can lead to drastically different outcomes over time.

One of the most common examples of a Strange Attractor is the Lorenz Attractor, named after the mathematician and meteorologist Edward Lorenz. The Lorenz Attractor is a simplified set of equations describing the weather/atmospheric patterns. It forms a butterfly-shaped pattern in its state space trajectory. This is infamously referred to as the "Butterfly Effect" â€” the idea that a butterfly flapping its wings can eventually influence a tornado weeks later.

## How to Run?
- Install Python on your system. ([Visit this Link](https://www.python.org/))
- Install pip python package installer ([Click here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/))
- Install numpy and matplotlib by entering the following commands in your terminal:
  <br/>
  <br/>
```bash
pip install numpy
```
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

> Scripts run over 100,000 iterations, so the speed of execution may vary depending on your system.
