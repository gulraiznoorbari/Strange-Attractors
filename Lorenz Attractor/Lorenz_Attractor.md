# Lorenz Attractor

## Description

The Lorenz Attractor is a chaotic attractor that is defined by the following system of equations:

```dx/dt = sigma * (y - x)```
<br/>
<br/>
```dy/dt = x * (rho - z) - y```
<br/>
<br/>
```dz/dt = x * y - beta * z```


## Parameters

| Variable | Value |
| -------- | ----- |
| sigma (```σ```) | 10  |
| rho (```ρ```)   | 28  |
| beta (```β```)  | 8/3 |
