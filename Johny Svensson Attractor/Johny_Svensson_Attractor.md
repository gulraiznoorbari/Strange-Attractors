# Johny Svensson Attractor

This Johny Svensson Attractor is a combination of Peter De Jong Attractor and Pickover's Attractor.

## Description

The Johny Svensson Attractor is a chaotic attractor that is defined by the following system of equations:

``` x = d * sin(x * a) - sin(y * b) ```
<br/>
<br/>
``` y = c * cos(x * a) + cos(y * b) ```

## Parameters

| Variable | Value |
| -------- | ----- |
| a        |  1.40 |
| b        |  1.56 |
| c        |  1.40 |
| d        | -6.56 |

## Output

After 100,000 iterations, the following attractor is generated:
